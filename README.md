Principal Component Analysis

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised learning method and also one of the important concepts in Data science.
PCA is often used to as a dimensionality reduction method for large datasets or simplify their complexity into small (transforming a large set of variables into a small one) while retaining most of the variation in the dataset. 
PCA reduces data by geometrically projecting it onto lower dimensions which in turn are called as Principal Components(PC). 
PCA methods goal is to find the best summary of our data by using the least amount of principal components, by choosing our principal components to minimize the distance between the original data and its projected values on the principal components.

Above the datasets link, I'm just taken the train.csv file [https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data?select=train.csv]


Steps:
 
1. Import the libraries. 
2. Load the dataset [MNIST dataset].
3. Preprocess the Data.
4. 2D Visualization using PCA Implementation.
5. PCA using Scikit-Learn.
6. PCA for Dimensionality Reduction [not for Visualization].
